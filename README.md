This example demonstrates a subtle bug in Ruby that can occur when instance variables are modified directly using `instance_variable_set` or `instance_variable_get`. While this approach might seem convenient for quick changes, it bypasses the class's methods and can result in unexpected behaviour and make it hard to track. The solution promotes using defined methods for consistent and controlled access to object data.
